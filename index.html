        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Isabella Morris and I am currently a Junior at Mt.Eden High school. This school year I decided to take a computer science class. In this course I have developed programing skills in languages such as c++, javascript, and scratch. Ive learned concepts like loops, if-statments, arrays, and many more. It has been fun creating and developing codes and personalizing projects. I have learned to be paitent with myself and to not get easily fustrated when my code isn't wokring how I intended it to. Reviewing code and debuging is something I have done a lot of this year. </p>
