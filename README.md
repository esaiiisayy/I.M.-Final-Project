# I.M.-Final-Project

## About Me
Hi, I'm Isabella Morris a student developer passionate about turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly web applications. Over the past year, I've been building my skills in front-end and back-end development, focusing on writing clean code, learning modern frameworks, and designing with accessibility in mind. This portfolio showcases the growth and range of my work as I continue developing my skills in software development and design.

## About This Project

This final portfolio is a culmination of my learning and development throughout the year. It represents not only the technical skills I’ve gained—such as working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks—but also my ability to think critically, solve problems, and present projects professionally. Creating this portfolio taught me how to refine my work, document projects clearly, and design with purpose and consistency.
